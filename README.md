# Affect-Recognition
Models for affect recognition using images

Image_affect.py file consists of CNNs coupled with RNNs trained together end-to-end to extract spatio-temporal features from sequence of images for affect recognition

AU_affect.py file consists of RNNs trained on extracted action units for affect recognition

FL_affect.py file consists of CNNs coupled with RNNs trained together end-to-end using a centralised Federated Learning approach to preserve users' privacy for affect recognition
